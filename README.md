digimon
=======

@borkborkNFork seems to think this needs  Readme. 

Digimon is a rediculously small Sinatra app that does nothing but return DNS addresses over a json API (though there is a basic view). 

Usage is simple, just hit /lookup.json?url=google.com for JSON or /lookup/google.com for the HTML view

Going to exapnd this for a more verbose dig response and include some whois functionality
